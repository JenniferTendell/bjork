# BJÖRK

Björk is a mocked webshop for interior design. You will see a nice selection of plates, lamps, candleholders and vases.
If you are an admin member you can also edit existing products and add new if you want. 

We used Grommet as a designsystem and here's the link for the Grommets documentation >> (Here!)[https://v2.grommet.io/docs]

Happy mocked shopping!
